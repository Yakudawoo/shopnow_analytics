Dashboard\n","\n","You’ve just joined **ShopNow**, a fast-growing online retailer specializing in consumer electronics and lifestyle products.\n","The **business intelligence team** needs **real-time visibility** into platform activity to support marketing campaigns and flash sales.\n","\n","They’ve asked you, as the **Analytics Engineer**, to design a data pipeline that provides:\n","\n","1. **Real-time counters** for total orders, revenue, and active users\n","2. **Rolling KPIs** — for example, sales and sessions in the last 5 minutes\n","3. **Live leaderboards** of top-selling products and categories\n","4. **Cached metrics** such as *Average Order Value (AOV)* for fast dashboard loading\n","5. **An interactive Streamlit dashboard** to visualize and monitor all of the above\n","\n","Your mission: build this entire end-to-end analytics system — from data collection to live visualization.\n","\n","## Part I - Generate real-time data\n","\n","For this project, we are
