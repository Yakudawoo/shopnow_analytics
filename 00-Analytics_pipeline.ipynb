Dashboard\n","\n","You’ve just joined **ShopNow**, a fast-growing online retailer specializing in consumer electronics and lifestyle products.\n","The **business intelligence team** needs **real-time visibility** into platform activity to support marketing campaigns and flash sales.\n","\n","They’ve asked you, as the **Analytics Engineer**, to design a data pipeline that provides:\n","\n","1. **Real-time counters** for total orders, revenue, and active users\n","2. **Rolling KPIs** — for example, sales and sessions in the last 5 minutes\n","3. **Live leaderboards** of top-selling products and categories\n","4. **Cached metrics** such as *Average Order Value (AOV)* for fast dashboard loading\n","5. **An interactive Streamlit dashboard** to visualize and monitor all of the above\n","\n","Your mission: build this entire end-to-end analytics system — from data collection to live visualization.\n","\n","## Part I - Generate real-time data\n","\n","For this project, we are going to mimic real users generating sales with Python.\n","\n","<Note type=\"note\">\n","\n","In real life Redis will be connected to a web-app that will generate actual data.\n","\n","</Note>\n","\n","In a seperate `.py` create a script that will:\n","\n","- randomly generate sales of the products below:\n","    - `Wireless Earbuds`\n","    - `Smartwatch`\n","    - `Gaming Keyboard`\n","    - `4K Monitor`\n","    - `Portable Speaker`\n","    - `Fitness Tracker`\n","    - `Mechanical Mouse`\n","    - `Bluetooth Headphones`\n","    - `Power Bank`\n","    - `Smart Home Hub`\n","- Update your redis database\n","- Sales should be generated infinitely over a random period of time each of 1 to 2 seconds\n","\n","\n","<Note type=\"hint\">\n","\n","- You should use the `random` library.\n","- Your project should look something like this:\n","\n","```\n","├── project_directory\n","   ├── sales_data_generator.py\n","   └── analytics_pipeline.ipynb (or
